For the "Prediction of Credit Card Fraud" project, you'll need several libraries to handle data manipulation, machine learning, balancing datasets, visualization, and model evaluation. Here's a list of key Python dependencies you should include in the requirements.txt file.
Python Dependencies

    Data Manipulation and Preprocessing:
        pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
        numpy: For numerical computations.

    Visualization:
        matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
        seaborn: For statistical data visualization (works well with pandas).

    Machine Learning:
        scikit-learn: For machine learning models, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
        imbalanced-learn: To handle imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE.

    Model Saving/Loading:
        joblib: For saving/loading models (you can also use pickle, but joblib is more efficient for large numpy arrays).

    Other Utility Libraries:
        xgboost: If you decide to use the XGBoost model, it's an efficient implementation for gradient boosting.
        shap (optional): For explainable AI, particularly if you want to visualize feature importance.
